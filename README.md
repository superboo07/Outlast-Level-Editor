# Outlast-Level-Editor
An Unoffical Custom Level Editor for Outlast. (Requires installation of UDK)

# Set Up
In order to set up this project you must install UDK, I recommend using the version linked here, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZed_3QAivpnU2uPlSClFVs-YOZrIpcd/view?usp=sharing. Make sure to install it to a seperate directory away from the repository, then copy the binaries folder from your new installation into where you cloned the repository, and then inside the binaries folder, launch the Unreal FrontEnd, then compile every script. Now the editor should be ready.
